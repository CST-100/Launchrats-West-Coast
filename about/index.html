  <h1> About Us</h1>
  <h3> LaunchRats West Coast and the people behind it. </h3>
  <p>LaunchRats West Coast was started in early 2018 as a way to get people interested in space travel on the American West coast. We're an offshoot of the original <a href="http://launchrats.com/">LaunchRats</a>, started by WaywardPlane, based in the Space Coast of Florida. This is currently a mostly one-man project, but we'll be expanding soon! </p>

  <p> Hi! I run this site, and 99% of what you see here is my work. I'm a California native who happens to be a little insane about space. I've been to 6 (soon 7) rocket launches, including NROL-45, Iridium-2/4/7, NASA InSight, JPSS-1, and soon ICESat-2. I'm currently a student, and in my spare time, I do 3D modeling, streaming, and work on this site! I'm also currently working towards a NAR L1 rocketry license.</p>
  
  <h3>More info coming soon, need to talk to the other team members first! </h3>
