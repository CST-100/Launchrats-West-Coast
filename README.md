# LaunchRats West Coast
### DEV r.0.5

I'm testing porting over my side project, LaunchRats West Coast, over here to github pages.

In case you don't know, Launchrats.com is currently a website developed by @WaywardPlane on twitter and covers all of the things going on at Kennedy Space Center. This is the West Coast version of that!
