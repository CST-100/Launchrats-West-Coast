# Delta II: The End of An Era
### The Shark has one last bite...

   As you may have heard, Delta II is on its way out. With the last 79xx (9 booster configuration) launching last November with JPSS-1, the booster only has one final mission: ICESat-2.

   This mission will fly on a Delta II 7420-10C. If you have absolutely no idea what any of that means, it’s a 7000-series (The current Delta configurations are 10000-series aka Delta IV) Delta II, with 4 GEM-40 boosters, an AJ-10 for the second stage, no third stage, and a 10 foot fairing. ICESat-2 itself is a NASA satellite built to map the terrain of the arctic, by using a LIDAR system. Originally supposed to launch 2 years ago, it was rescheduled after a problem with said LIDAR system (which happens to be the only experiment on the entire satellite). 

   Its launch date is September 15, 2018. When it does launch, it will enter a roughly circular 496 kilometer orbit around the Earth, at a near polar 92 degree inclination. This mission will hopefully be Delta II’s 100th consecutive successful mission and its 154th successful mission, an unparalleled record.

   The end of Delta II’s reign leaves a few questions behind, though. For example, who will take over SLC-2? The answer to that would be Firefly Aerospace. Their Alpha launch vehicle is about the same size as Electron and would be comparable to the Minotaur vehicle that launches out of LC-576e, along with their Beta vehicle, which would be comparable to the European Vega and lie somewhere in between Delta II and Electron. This is not 100% confirmed, but there have been talks of this happening.

   Another question: what boosters will replace the Delta II? Currently the closest thing ULA offers to it is the Atlas V 401, which doubles the price for 3 times the payload (in their base configurations) but boasts many of the same benefits of Delta II. Other than that, none of the big players really offer a replacement, other than NGIS (formerly Orbital ATK)’s Antares.

   Only time will tell what will come of Delta II, but don’t get disappointed yet. Up next at Vandenberg: A Delta IV Heavy, and a Falcon 9 RTLS.
