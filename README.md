# LaunchRats West Coast
### DEV b0.6

LaunchRats West Coast has been ported to GitHub pages! A lot of changes are coming soon relating to the ICESat-2 mission. Check the project under "projects" for more info!

In case you don't know, Launchrats.com is currently a website developed by @WaywardPlane on twitter and covers all of the things going on at Kennedy Space Center. This is the West Coast version of that!
