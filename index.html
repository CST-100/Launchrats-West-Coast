  <p>Welcome! LaunchRats West Coast has finally been ported to GitHub pages! You'll notice a few new things I've been working hard to implement, including a new blog! The design will be pretty minimal for now, but it'll evolve as we go. Thanks for trying it out!</p>

  <h3> Blog: </h3>
  <p> Everything from launch schedules to viewing information will be posted here whenever relevant. </p>
