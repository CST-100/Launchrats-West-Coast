# ICESat-2 mission success!
### The final mission of Delta II, and a spectacular one at that.

*By Coolstorm*

  6:02 AM, Saturday, September 15, 2018 was the time that ICESat-2 took off on the final Delta II. The launch was a success, and the payload made it to its orbit. While fog was a definite nuisance for any spectators, those who were lucky got to see the liftoff and pad, unlike me, as the viewing location I had planned to go to had been blocked off. This was Delta II's 100th successful mission in a row, ULA's 130th successful mission in a row (and ever), and flight 381 of the Delta series. Here's ULA's video of the launch highlights for this mission.

Next up, a RTLS Falcon 9 with the SAOCOM-1A mission on October 7.
