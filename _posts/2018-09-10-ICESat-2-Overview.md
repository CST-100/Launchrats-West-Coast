# ICESat-2 Mission Overview
### Viewing locations, launch information, and more.
*by Coolstorm*

   We're now about 5 days away from the final flight of Delta II! This final flight will carry ICESat-2, a mission that will help map the terrain of the poles. For more information about that and what happens after the mission, see the post [Delta II: End of an Era](http://west.launchrats.com/2018/09/07/Delta-II-End-of-an-Era). ICESat-2 will fly on a Delta II 7420-10C, aka a Delta II with 4 boosters. It launches from SLC-2W, one of the trickier launch sites to get near. However, there's still a few places you can try.

   For viewing the launch, you're best off trying the SLC-2W bleachers at Skyscreen and Corral Road, and the site at Marshallia Ranch Road. Surf Train Station is NOT reccomended as it will almost definitely get blocked off, and Ocean Avenue is a little too far. Due to the launch's timing, there is a pretty high chance of fog, but the ceiling will usually be high enough on the marine layer to let you see the rocket pre-launch. Another important thing, if you call the number **+1 (321) 867-7135**, you might get a live replay of the countdown net audio. This is great as Vandenberg usually has no reception during launches. However, said number only works during NASA launches, so whether it works this time will be a toss-up.
   
   Speaking of timing, the launch occurs at 5:46 AM PT. The window is 40 minutes long, ending at 6:26 AM. If the launch gets delayed to at least 6 AM, the rocket will enter sunlight, creating the "Suncatcher" effect popularized by Iridium-4 and CRS-15. However, it will not create this effect if it launches on time, meaning this is one of the few launches where you would want to hope for a delay. 
   
   All in all, while it's sad to see Delta II go, this final launch is shaping up to be a great one, and definitely not one to miss. Delta II served as America's workhorse with an unmatched record and decades of service. So here's to one final launch, and a great one at that. Fly safe, and (hopefully) see you there.
